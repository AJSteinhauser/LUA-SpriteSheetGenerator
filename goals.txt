I want a spritesheet generator that will take in sprites and output a images and code
  + Able to handle unlimited files
  - Files cannot be > 1024 x or y direction 
  + outputs one module 
  + does not waste canvas size (if the image is short do not generate full 1024 sized canvas)
  + Earlier created sheets have precidence to be filled over newer sheets 
  +
